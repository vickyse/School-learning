        <div class="about_me" style="line-height: 1.8;">
            My name is Vic Hong, an international student studying in master of IT
            in the University of Queensland. I have a strong interest in database
            and backend program development. Although the project of this semester
            was primarily related to frontend development, I still enjoyed working
            on JavaScript of the project and collaborating with my teammates to build
            a project from scratch. In this project, I was mainly responsible for
            developing the interactive functions of the website. In this webpage,
            the project would be divided by me into three parts, which are design
            proposal, MVP milestones, and final product to respectively introduce
            how we completed this project, as well as a clear explanation of my
            individual contributions in each part.

            Part A - Design Proposal
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            Proposed design concept:
            <div class="inside_content">
                1. In Australia, there are 1,402 plant species and subspecies are
                nationally listed as threatened (Australian Wildlife Conservancy, 2022).
                Australia is a beautiful continent with a rich diversity of flora and fauna.
                However, it actually has almost 1,400 plant species are currently listed as
                endangered by related authorities. As a result, we aimed to create a website
                that offers our users some basic information of these endangered plants.
            </div>
            <div class="inside_content" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
                2. Longer books, for example, are considered less “fun”. (Marsh, 2023).
                Dr. Marsh points out that in certain cases, excessive information and text
                may not be ideal for readers. Combining both perspectives, our expectation
                for our project was to provide users with valuable information while maintaining
                an engaging and interactive experience.
            </div>
            Interaction / Task flow:
            <div class="inside_content" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
                The design focuses on creating interactive learning
                experiences for children to easily obtain information about endangered plants.

            Low fidelity:
            <div class="inside_content" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
                The pictures below represent the low-fidelity of the website.
                At this stage, we initially decided to provide plant information retrieved from API.
                The components below are the primary reason for why the plant is endangered.
                On the right side, an animation of the plant's growth processes is demonstrated.
                However, once upon the disaster button is pressed, regardless of the plant's current
                growth stage, the disaster animation will appear. Additionally, the website is
                designed with a search and a "surprise me" function.

            Reflection of part A:
            <div class="inside_content">
                The low-fidelity design served a foundation
                for us to understand how to begin our project. We then brainstormed on how to
                present the project properly and explore various of other websites for inspiration.

        <div class="content">
            Overview:
            <div class="inside_content">
                Starting from Part B, our team members had clearly divided our roles into two groups.
                The female members are all from Master of Interaction Design, and they would be
                responsible for creating the report of presentation user testing, and the design of the
                website. On the other hand, the male members, including myself, are all from master of IT,
                we would focus on completing all the web development tasks.

                The pictures above were the websites prototypes designed by female members after they
                completed the design process and user testing. Left one show the outfit out gallery page
                while right one is description page. Tao is other teammate of us and he would be responsible
                for gallery page, and me, were distributed to take the part of description page.
            </div>
            Individual contribution:
            <div class="inside_content" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
                I was responsible for creating the row bar in the website. Frontend development is an area
                I was actually not very familiar with, and building a horizontal bar was quite challenging for me.
                I continually repeated two activities: searching the internet, and recalling what I learned in my
                previous course, 7140, and eventually, I successfully completed the task. My core concept was to
                add a crucial CSS class called ".slider_dragged" within the row bar. Secondly, set its
                initial width to 0 and positioned it to the left of the handle. Then, I added event
                listeners to track the user's mouse coordinates within the website and dynamically
                adjusted the width of the elements within the ".slider_dragged" class. This made it
                visually appear like the handle is being moving. As for binding the images of a plant’s
                growth stages to the handle, my approach was to stack all the images together in the frame
                initially. I used JavaScript to monitor the width of ".slider_dragged." When the width range
                is 0 to 800 (the width of the slider) / 6, I adjusted the z-index of the first image to 1
                while keeping the others at 0, representing the seed stage. When the width increases from
                800 / 6 to 800 / 3, it transitions to the second growth stage image, and so on. In
                In this way, as I moved the slider from left to right, visually the plant would
                grow through its stages one by one. And below is a piece of my JavaScript code and the result.

            Reflection of part B:
            <div class="inside_content" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
                We received a good score in MVP part. Tutors praised the design and interactivity
                of our website's MVP. The factor where we were marked down were missing some of
                the components that the professor had required. For instance, we ignored listing
                each team member's responsibilities, self-assessment of our strengths and weaknesses,
                and a reflection of making the MVP. These components indeed provide valuable insights,
                and we should document them.

                At this stage, we clearly divide the tasks and everyone dived into their responsibilities
                deeply for the final product. The female team members are responsible for gathering all
                the necessary data for the website. Tao was in charge of all the API references for our
                website and the creation of the gallery page. The remaining parts were being handled by me,
                which includes the main website homepage and the detailed pages for plant introductions.
            </div>
            Individual contribution:
            <div class="inside_content">
                During this period, it was the most challenging period for us. Tutors pointed out a crucial
                point when assessing our detailed page development process. The main objective of this course
                is to present tedious API data in an interactive manner. However, we were primarily focused
                on developing the original interactivity we designed for our website, and for the data
                retrieved from the API, we were merely "presenting" it (Image 1 below). This was not what the professor
                expected. To fix this issue, we consulted tutors for multiple times and hosted numerous of online
                meetings. Ultimately, during a discussion with the tutors, we decided to import a text-to-speech API
                into our website and develop a drag-and-drop system to present the content "interactively" (Image 2
                below).
                Due to that I still had to handle other tasks within the website, one of our team members, Olive,
                volunteered to develop the drag-and-drop system, leaving me to focus on adding the text-to-speech API.

                Overall, the final product was successful in both design style and interaction with the data. Before the
                final presentation, we sought feedback from potential users. The testing results indicated a positive
                outcome of the project, with participants being able to navigate the website easily and fully understand
                the function of each feature. During the follow-up interview, participants suggested the refined
                function, the drag-and-drop section, can assist their learning process, which aligns with the project's
                goal of enhancing the user's learning experience. Additionally, the UI of the project served as an
                encouraging response at the tradeshow, which reinforces the user-friendly nature of the website. “When I
                try to complete the information, I do feel like I’m learning along the process.” “I’m learning and
                playing at the same time!”

            <div class="inside_content" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
                However, the teaching team has pointed out a few issues that were not identified during the previous
                testing phase. For instance, the logo on the top of the website does not serve as a link to the homepage
                of the website; as the design does not match real-world conventions, users can be confused and face
                difficulty when navigating. Furthermore, when users enter the detailed page of a plant, there is not
                much way for users to determine where they are on the website. Therefore, the website's orientation
                needs to be improved; upon completing the iteration in the future, the team believes the website users
                will be able to find their way around more easily.

                This semester, it was my first time creating a project from scratch, and I deeply realised that it is
                not an easy task. Throughout the process of brainstorming, drafting, building an MVP, and even creating
                the final product, disagreements within the team were quite common. However, these situations were
                valuable learning experiences, not just in terms of project development but also in understanding the
                importance of teamwork. In the future, when we work in companies, team projects will likely be more
                frequent than individual one, as a result, teamwork may be more crucial. I am also grateful to my
                teammates, no matter what difficulties we faced, we never considering giving up, however, we kept
                maintaining a good communication to solve the issues especially during the final product development. In
                that period, figuring out how to present API data interactively was quite a rollercoaster. We may not
                necessarily cross paths in the upcoming courses, but I still wish everyone the best of luck on our
                future adventures.
